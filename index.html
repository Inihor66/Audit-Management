README: How to Run and Payment Flow Simulation

**How to Run:**
1. This is a single-page React application built with static files (HTML, CSS, JS).
2. You do not need to install any dependencies or run a build process.
3. Simply open this `index.html` file in a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge). The application will start automatically.
4. All data is stored in your browser's `localStorage`. To reset the application, clear your browser's `localStorage` for this page.

**Payment Flow Simulation:**
The subscription payment flow is a simulation and does not involve real money. Here's how it works:
1. **Firm User:** A user logged in as a 'Firm' can navigate to their profile page and then to the "Manage Subscription" page.
2. **Select Plan:** The firm selects a subscription plan (e.g., Monthly, Yearly).
3. **Payment Instructions:** The app displays a static UPI ID for payment. This is for demonstration purposes only.
4. **Upload Screenshot:** The firm is asked to upload a "payment screenshot." They can upload any image file.
5. **Notify Admin:** After uploading, the firm clicks "Notify Admin." This action saves the uploaded image as a data URL in `localStorage` and creates a notification for the Admin.
6. **Admin Confirmation:** An 'Admin' user logs in, sees the payment notification on their dashboard, and can view the uploaded screenshot.
7. **Activate Subscription:** The Admin clicks a "Confirm Payment" button. This manually updates the firm's account in `localStorage`, activating their subscription, setting the plan details, and granting them unlimited form entries.
8. **Firm Notification:** The firm receives an in-app notification confirming their subscription is active.
